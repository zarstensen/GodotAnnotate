### Annotate and Edit Mode

A canvas has to primary modes, the **Annotate Mode** and the **Edit mode**.
You can see and change which mode the selected canvas is currently in via. the **Mode**![](src/toolbar/annotate_toolbar_icon.svg)switch on the toolbar. If it is highlighted it is in **Annotate Mode**, otherwise it is in **Edit Mode**.

**Annotate Mode** is the default mode. When in this mode, you can draw and erase strokes on the canvas.

**Edit Mode** allows one to select strokes on the canvas and perform edits on them, such as resizing them or change various other properties via. the editor's node inspector. 

### Hitbox Generation

Perform the following steps to generate a hitbox from an **AnnotateCanvas**![canvas-icon].

- add a **CanvasCollisionShape**![canvas-collision-shape-icon] node as a child of any [**CollisionObject2D**](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_collisionobject2d.html) node.
- Assign the **Canvas** property to the desired **AnnotateCanvas**![canvas-icon] node.

This adds a series of [**CollisionShape2D**](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_collisionshape2d.html) nodes to the **CanvasCollisionShape**'s![canvas-collision-shape-icon] parent, which represent the hitbox of all strokes present in the assigned **AnnotateCanvas**![canvas-icon]. 

### Save as Image

- Press the **Capture Canvas** ![](src/toolbar/capture_canvas_toolbar_icon.svg) button.
- Choose the upscale factor in the following popup window[^1].
- Specify the path of the image file, and press '**Ok**'

## Footnotes
[^1]: The upscale factor is based on the window resolution, so if the canvas takes up a total of 100 x 100 px's worth of window space, an upscale factor of 1 would produce an 100 x 100 px image, whilst an upscale factor of 2 would produce a 200 x 200 px image.
